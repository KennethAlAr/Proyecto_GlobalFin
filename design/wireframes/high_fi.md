# Wireframes High-Fidelity – Aura Wellness

After settling on the flow in `low_fi.md`, upgrade to grayscale or partial color with real typography.
Aim for accessibility (WCAG contrast, large touch targets) while reflecting Aura's visual identity.

## Visual rules
- Use system fonts (e.g., Roboto, San Francisco).
- Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast for text on background.
- Buttons: 44×44pt minimum size, primary action uses brand color.
- Provide alt text for images and icons.

# Wireframes Low-Fidelity – Aura Wellness

This document captures the first set of black-and-white wireframes for the Aura Wellness mobile app.
The goal is to solidify the user journey without visual styling.

## 1. Onboarding / Welcome flow

```
[Splash screen]
      ↓
[Login]  [Sign up]
      ↓
[Terms & Privacy]
      ↓
[Permissions (notifications, location)]
```

Notes:
- Keep screens minimal: logo/place for header, single primary action button.
- Navigation is linear; "Back" just returns to previous.

## 2. Home Screen

```
[Header: greeting + avatar]

[Daily summary card]
    • Mood
    • Steps / activity

[Quick actions row]
    • Start session  • Log meal  • Chat coach

[Footer nav]
  Home | Sessions | Profile | Help
```

## 3. Session Detail

```
[Session title]
[Progress indicator]
[Play/Pause]  [Next]
[Notes area]
```

## 4. Profile / Settings

```
[Avatar]
[Name]
[Email]
[Preferences toggle list]
- Notifications
- Dark mode
- Language

[Logout button]
```

### Using these wireframes
1. Sketch on paper or in a tool (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD).
2. Validate flow with pen/paper before coding.
3. Iterate quickly: low cost to scribble on new screen order.
